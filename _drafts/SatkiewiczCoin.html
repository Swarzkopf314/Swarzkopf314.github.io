Independent machine learning researcher and half-time web developer.

I'm immensely curious, always trying to get into the gist of problems. Trying to answer some of the most profound questions using formal tools of programming, logic and maths but sometimes also a simple natural language.
​
I solved an open problem (published) in coarse topology already in my bachelor's thesis, during holidays (and it even scored few citations). I found a bug in Ruby programming language. I was finalist of LIX Polish Mathematical Olympiad, received scholarship for the best students during my studies at MIM UW, joined Polish Mensa (only to get disappointed). Always looking for more, trying to get deeper and clearer understanding of things. This way naturally I tend to come out with pretty interesting, sometimes crazy ideas.
​
If you can't program it, you don't really get it.
​
I've been working on my own project - a machine learning library - since January 2018, aiming to come out with a fast algorithm that simulates the way animals and humans process and learn their environments. I've got some results already, but I still want to test more ideas and build an even better, cleaner and more general algorithm. Once I'm done with the research, I'm starting a company that will build on top of it.

Token:

I've created the token out of curiosity, it yields an interesting economy. In best-case scenario it's also a way to fund my research (current and every future one). I'm determined to create a huge value during my lifetime and if I succeed, every holder of my token will also benefit from it :) 
​
More precisely: For every project and company I'll be starting in the future I'll emit it's token and airdrop it to every holder of SatkiewiczCoin, proportionally to the amount one has. 
​
And that's it. If you believe I can create something of value, then you should buy my token - the sooner, the better :) It will help me to create that value and not get distracted by pure money-earning activities.
