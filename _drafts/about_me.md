### We are all in the gutter, but some of us are building rockets.

When I was in high school I was stumbled by the mistery of life. The value of everything we know depends on the broadest context - which we don't know really. I decided to treat this mistery as seriously as possible.

Why don't people do everything they can to understand who they are and what the world really is, what consciousness is, instead they just settle down with the semblance of knowledge we have so far and just enjoy the ride, accepting the prospect of ceasing to exist in an absolute sense - without even knowing what all of this really means? Well, maybe it's all about the love and the fun, the "here and now". This could be some kind of training simulation, maturity exam of some advanced society to teach us important values in the best way possible, but still it's just a comforting guess? Why are people so content with the artificial intersubjective world they created instead of tirelessly striving towards the truth? With all that mental capabilities they have? They just make so much less of themselves.

I'd assume its a natural thing to do if you take the world seriously (as you should) and don't pretend that you know anything about it for sure (as you shouldn't). It's a giant mistery standing constantly in front of our eyes and yet most people choose to ignore it.

I chose to embrace it.

I tried poetry, philosophy, physics, logic and maths. Quite successfully, I solved an open problem from a young subject (coarse topology) in my bachelor thesis, then I switched to logic hoping to understand the very basics of our reasing. I saw gaping holes in the very fundaments of (classical and first order) logic and how are they ignored by the majority of mathematicians. But I also realised that it doesn't matter. It's just a precise tool we created to serve our needs. There's nothing absolute even in the fundaments of mathematics.

I saw that the true value is in what we create. I still agree that the true discovery can be made only in formal language, but logic and math are too abstract. I became a programmer. I realised one could build rockets out of mere words. 

We are blessed to live in the times of computers and programming languages. You can create worlds out of words, more, you can test your ideas by writing simple scripts. This saves you a ton of time - a promising idea which could take you 20years to investigate, write books about can be discarded now by a simple program. Programming can 

We are just monkeys, repeating what we've seen or heard. We create value by semi-randomly putting together ideas, which sometimes luckily leads to a new discovery. But we need to experiment to gain knowledge, we need the world to test our ideas. Otherwise we are just stuck in a boring, always cliched fantasy.

What question can be realistically answered in our inspiring times? Can we simulate the way we think? Can we simulate our consciousness, our intelligence? If we could, this could be a major, profound insight. It's high time to do this.

Today's deep learning stuff is at heart clunky and missing the point. It's a brute force attitude giving no insight. I want to approach the problem differently.

First of all I want to create an agend living in a simple, simulated reality - simple atari game like pacman or pong - and learning to avoid penalties and gain rewards QUICKLY - just as a young rat or other animal would do. I want to make an agent that behaves analogously to small animals. That will be the first step.

I already discovered an alternate way of learning quickly and predicting local dynamics of an environment. For that purpose I use a very neat and general trick which basically represents intuition and long-term memory. This achieves 97% accuracy on MNIST data out of the box and trains extremely quickly. 

I also have an idea how to implement short-term memory and how to integrate newly aquired knowledge with the long-term. I'm very close to achieving my goal. But I don't know of 

In future I'd like to hire lots of people and build something huge together, helping to solve complex problems of our wolrd and strivng towards the ultimate mystery. I don't want to depend on anybody and I don't want to be dependent on death, for that matter. I'm protesting against taking anything for granted, against simple answers. And if there's no meaning to this world after all - lets create that meaning. We don't have much time.

Currently I'm self-financing my project by working 4h/day in a software company. It's a nice deal but I feel I'm moving forward too slowly. I want to be more impactfull. Lend me your energy :)

The more you help me the higher chance I will actually achieve my ultimate goal, which could benefit all of us. If I could create a

### We are all in the gutter, but some of us are building rockets. v2

I'm a philosopher and poet who graduated from maths and is a pretty good programmer. 

When I was in high school I realised that the world is a beatifull mystery that has to be taken seriously. I decieded what better thing to do in life than to try to solve that mystery? At first I tried philosophy and poetry, trying to grasp the very essence of existence. But soon I realised that natural language is not enough. I learned that the true discovery can be only done with the help of formal language. Therefore I studied physics but I had too many doubts about the mathematical reasoning behind it (there were too many holes in the reasoning) - so after one year I decided to study mathematics instead. I dived very deeply into foundations of mathematics and formal logic - still in the search of some absolute truth underlying our reasoning and perhaps the existance. But there was no such thing - even the most basic logical derivations widely accepted by mathematical community, under carefull scrutiny - are arbitrary and suspicious - and one just has to accept, that constructs such as infinity or mere classical first order logic are just handy tools humans developed to study relations between abstract concepts - tools that are general, but no more "true" than simple words in something as vague as natural language. Even after diving into the very depths of mathematical logic the world still remained a mistery. But it was a priceless adventure. And then I knew what to do next.

Programming is just an extension of logic - but it's practical and basically it's an extension of one's mind. Oftentimes you can test your ideas by writing a simple computer script - 

I'm pretty serious about it.

Yet I have this prohibiting psychological feature, a strong need to be independent from others, from rules or even from death itself. I could work for Google (at least they were the first to contact me to start the recruitment process) but I realised I need to pursue my own goals, answer my own questions. It's pretty demanding as you can't see the immediate result of your effort - you follow your intuitions but you stay in the dark for the most part - and you start to doubt yourself. But the only way is to keep pushing.

Twoje życie to komedia improwizowana, żonglerka konwencjami, które bierzesz zbyt poważnie. Twoja wiedza to zbiór arbitralnych struktur, które mają sens, o ile możesz je sprawdzić w praktyce, a bez tego są jałowymi historyjkami, które dają Ci co najwyżej poczucie, że coś rozumiesz. Tym strukturom też za często ufasz. Przykładowo to, co nazywasz "kosmosem" jest dużo mniej realne, niż pies, którego głaszczesz albo kamień, którym możeesz rzucić. Jeśli nic nie wiesz, to wypada chociaż słuchać swojego serca.

Jednakże skoro nic nie wiem, to mogę przewrotnie dociekać prawdy. Trolluję w ten sposób rzeczywistość i śmieję się w twarz pozornej pustce oraz ludziom, którzy "wiedzą" za dużo.

Tutaj robię to mało poważnie, bo używam języka naturalnego, a kryterium prawdy jest moja intuicja; jest to więc na dobrą sprawę taka paplanina bez pokrycia. 

Żeby szukać prawdy efektywnie, powinienem budować coś, co jest weryfikowalne w praktyce. Mamy dziś wspaniałe narzędzia poznawcze w postaci nauk ścisłych, w szczególności języków programowania, dzięki którym można budować precyzyjne struktury, które wykraczają daleko poza pojemność naszych umysłów i są niezależne od naszych intuicji i przekonań. Najbardziej złożona teoria może być obalona za pomocą odpowiedniego programu, który wbrew naszym nadziejom nie działa.

Jeśli nie potrafisz tego zaprogramować, to tak naprawdę nie wiesz, co mówisz. 

Jako, że nie podoba mi się perspektywa bycia egzystencjalnym pajacem, któremu za dużo się wydaje, to faktycznie tak robię. Programuję i weryfikuję swoje intuicje dotyczące działania świadomości. Efekty poznacie w przyszłości. Z resztą sami powinniście zacząć efektywnie szukać prawdy o nas i o świecie. No chyba, że nie macie czasu, bo pochłania Was jakaś codzienna, wyjęta z zadu konwencja, w którą wcisnęliście swoje życia. W takim wypadku życzę udanej śmierci.

Ten blog to mimo wszystko zabawa. Humor, którego istotą nie jest gra słów czy zmyślny fałsz, tylko prawda. Na przekór. Zawsze i wszędzie. Bo można by odpuścić, wybrać łatwe rozwiązanie, skłamać. Tutaj kwestionujemy i pytamy tym bardziej, im bardziej mamy dość. Przecież to zabawne.
