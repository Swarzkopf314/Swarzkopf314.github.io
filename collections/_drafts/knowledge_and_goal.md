Without knowledge I'm basically powerless, blind. I need knowledge to have power and insight; and I need those to care for the creation and to help it grow. That's my ultimate motivation which I cannot further explain.

I feel so frustrated when I see lost potential. Dramatically suboptimal solutions or people wasting their amazing potential for no reason, because they are lost.

I want to have power to heal but heal only so much that the person can stand up and grow by himself. I want them to have vision. To go beyond the given, whether in science, art or human realtions.

The very essence of our being is to create. We are designed to innovate. We sample over models of reality, that is models of perception, predicted perception. We are designed to create models which predict perception. By definition we are meant to create.
